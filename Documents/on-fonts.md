# On Fonts

### Settling on a set of fonts is hard

There are a zillion different fonts. Each has their own personality, vibe, _feel_. Fonts are nuanced. Something that wows on screen can disappoint on the page. A font that looks amazing on the printed page can make a webpage look stilted. Fonts that look great in small doses, look mediocre once viewed as a page full of text.

We have all wasted countless hours trying one font and then the next and then the next. The more presentation-focused a project is, the more difficult the choice. The more permanent the choice—printed material for example—it becomes even more difficult.

_**Developmental writing**_

When it comes to developmental writing in the earliest stages, the choice of font becomes relatively easy: use whatever you like.

In the latter stages, when you need to submit to an agent, settle on something neutral, traditional, and utilitarian (easy to read, no artistic flourishes).

Finally, when you submit to a publisher, use whatever that publisher demands. And if they do not have a preference, fall back to—you guessed it—neutral, traditional, and utilitarian.

_**Publishing**_

If you self-publishing (printed, ebook, ePub, or blog), your font choices matter far more as does the general design of the book itself. Book content design is an entire subject unto itself that I will not go into here.

## TL;DR: the fonts I use

> **Spoiler alert!**
>
> <span style="font-size: 75%;">This is a long article just to say that nine times out of ten, you want to choose a Times New Roman equivalent for most stages of the revision and submission process.</span>

We'll discuss all kinds of fonts here in a second, but to keep things grounded, here are the fonts I predominantly use at the moment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

**For print (LibreOffice)**
* Submission: TeX Gyre Termes and _maybe_ TeX Gyre Pagella or TeX Gyre Heros or Overpass for headings
* Publishing:
  - Text body: EB Garamond, Cormorant Garamand Medium, Cardo (11pt), Libre Caslon Text (10pt), or Crimson Text
  - Headings: TeX Gyre Pagella, Overpass or Carlito, Montserrat, or Avería Sans (or Serif) Libre (the Avería fonts are almost too fancy).

**For print (Google Docs)**
* Submission: Tinos and _maybe_ Quicksand for headings
* Publishing: Don't use Google Docs for documents targeting publication.

**For the web:** I maintain three websites using these fonts:
1. Text: Cardo / Headings: Source Sans Pro
2. Text: Source Serif Pro / Headings: Source Sans Pro
3. Text: Libre Caslon Text / Headings: Avería Sans Libre  
   &nbsp;  
   Specialized usage (used for some blog posts): Chilanka, Overpass, Overpass Mono, and Fira Mono

## Fonts from Draft &#x27F6; Submission

### The big three: Times New Roman, Courier New, and Arial

**Times New Roman.** Times is a proportional serif font for which writers, editors, everyone have settled on as _the_ default standard for submission. Or just about everyone. And heck, even if self-publishing, Times is boring, but it is a safe and reliable font choice for your book as well. Times is a readable and reasonably attractive font.

**Courier New.** Courier is a monospace serif font that _used_ to be the choice for drafting and submission. Typewriters produced documents in courier font, therefore, manuscripts were expected in that format. Only recently has this legacy font died off as the preferred choice of editors. We no longer use typewriters nor do we submit hard-copy manuscripts. Even that Luddite of Luddites, Wendell Berry, has someone (his wife I believe) type up his handwritten manuscripts (written in _pencil_ by the way), into a computer, and that is what is submitted to his publisher. There may be some editor out there that still prefers your manuscript be submitted in a monospaced serif font, but it's highly unlikely.

**Arial.** Rumor has it that some editors prefer the copy be in a sans-serif font. They are crazy people, but if so, Arial is the typical choice.

### But! But! Linux doesn't supply these fonts!

You see, we say Times New Roman, Courier New, and Arial, but those are brand names for a certain set of designs. Designs where the type foundries that own them essentially have a proprietary lock on them.

What editors are really asking for are highly readable, cleanly designed fonts that are either proportional and serif (Times), monospace and serif (Courier), or proportional and sans-serif (Arial). They have become generic defaults. It's like requiring Kleenex tissues and Clorox bleach.

Linux users don't typically have those name brand fonts available. And in fact, for a very long time, there were no really good open source fonts. The Linux desktop was full of usable, but unattractive grainy fonts that served as poor substitutes for fonts provided by the proprietary world of Apple and Windows.

It took awhile for the open source world to catch up to the proprietary world (fonts where not a priority for Linux users in those early days), but they finally did. Now, the variety of fonts available are rather insane in number.

Many fonts are available as packaged items&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

> * In the Gnome desktop, open the _Software_ application (gnome-software)
> * Click "Add-ons" and then "Fonts"
> * At the time of this writing (May 5th, 2020 and Fedora 31), I count 272 fonts available.

But even more can be found at [OpenFont](https://openfont.com), [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com), and [FontSquirrel](https://fontsquirrel.com).

And with that, Times New Roman—and Courier New and Arial and the rest—have open alternatives that, I would argue, are just as mature and effective today as the ones they emulate. Some reasonable alternatives include&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
* Times New Roman &#x27F6; Liberation Serif, Tinos, TeX Gyre Termes
* Courier New &#x27F6; Cousine, Noto Mono, TeX Gyre Cursor
* Arial &#x27F6; Arimo, Liberation Sans, Noto Sans, Overpass, TeX Gyre Heros

> **In short: For submission of a manuscript, pick a Times-like font unless you are asked to do otherwise.**

## More Artful Fonts for Publication and Presentation

For publication, heavy text websites, and more, you probably want something more nuanced than Times New Roman. And you want to start considering different fonts for different purposes (headers, text body, quotations and asides, etc.).

That being said, unless you really really need to make a statement that requires it, stick to fonts that are nuanced rather than boldly different or bizarre. One of the most commonly cited criticism of poorly designed self-published books is that authors sometimes pick distracting fonts. Don't do that. Er on the side of conservatism.

### Font categories and some associated fonts

This is kinda how they are broken down.

> _<span style="font-size: 75%;">Note: I assuming a baseline font size of 12pt. You may have to adjust up or down depending on how the font looks on the page. The draft through submission fonts should all be locked at 12pts and should not need to be adjusted unless you are using something a bit more fancy than expected.</span>_

#### Serif (aka Roman)

The fonts that have little decorative things at the end of the strokes used to draw them. In theory—and there is some modest science to back this claim—serif fonts are easier to read.

Proportional — Each character takes up space that is complementary to that characters form. An _M_ will take up more horizontal space than an _I_.

Monospace — Each character takes up precisely the same amount of space as any other character.

Serif fonts can be further classified: Old-style, Transitional, Didone, Slab serif, and more. We won't discuss those here.

#### Sans-Serif (aka Gothic)

Fonts that are literally _sans_, or without, serif. They don't have extra decorators at the end of the stokes that define them. They can, TeX Gyre Schola (Century Schoolbook-like) be, similarly to serif fonts, proportional or monospace.

> For print, sans-serif fonts are best used for headers or blocks of specialized text mixed in with serif text. In this way the sans-serif text acts as a complementary but differentiating typeface.

#### [Cursive Script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typefaces#Script), Brush, Calligraphic, Handwriting, Other

Cursive. There's a whole group of fonts that mimic hand-printed text, scripted text, and calligraphy. These fall into what some call the "cursive" font grouping. It's a terrible category name, but it hints at what may be included.

_**Cursive examples:**_  
TeX Gyre Choral (Zapf Chancery-like), Architects Daughter, Steve Hand, SMonohand, Grand Hotel, Serafettin Cartoon, Isabella, Chilanka

Other character fonts. There a lot of subcategories that I am not going to spell out, but for now we'll call them "other." Art decco, block-characters .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all those characters that are text but very specialized and not organic (hand-written).

_**Other character fonts examples:**_  
Cormorant Unicase, Comorant SC, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Symbols. Glyphs and images that aren't letters. Emoji. Dingbats. And more. Useful for [separators and flourishes between scenes and things](https://www.thebookdesigner.com/2010/06/book-design-8-solutions-to-the-text-break-dilemma/) in stories and books. I'll let you find these on your own. :)

## Whew!

Once you have whittled down the fonts that interest you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
* If it is a webpage: Zoom in and out; stretch the window; make it tall; print the webpage. What happens?
* If it is a manuscript: Print a handful of pages for each font and look at them and consider: Do the fonts disappear from my attention when I read the page? Are they easy to read? Print a 12pt Times New Roman comparable and make sure the font size is the same and the double-spacing for each are adequate.
* If it is a book: Print out a handful of pages for each candidate font and compare them to books from your bookshelf. Again, are they attractive _and_ non-distracting? Does the tone of each font fit the genre of your writing? What do other books in your genre use for their fonts, both headings and body text?
* Check out the [FontPair website](https://fontpair.co/) for ideas inspiration.

&nbsp;
Fonts can lead you down a path of darkness and sorrow. Be careful out there. Just make sure you are happy with the fonts you have chosen. Good luck!
