# On Fonts

### Settling on a set of fonts is hard

There are a zillion different fonts. Each has their own personality, vibe, _feel_. Fonts are nuanced. Something that wows on screen can disappoint on the page. A font that looks amazing on the printed page can make a webpage look stilted. Fonts that look great in small doses, look mediocre once viewed as a page full of text. And some fonts make great headers but terrible in the text body.

We have all wasted countless hours trying one font and then another and then another. The more the success of a project hinges on how it looks and feels, the more difficult the choice. The more permanent—for printed material for example—the choice becomes truly challenging.

Choosing a font for your project is a gigantic topic. But for our purposes, in this document, we are focused on the needs of the writer, and not the needs of an advertiser, designer, or graphic artist.

_**Developmental writing**_

When it comes to developmental writing in the earliest stages, the choice of font becomes relatively easy: use whatever you like.

In the latter stages, when you need to submit to an agent or a publisher, choose something neutral, unobtrusive, traditional, utilitarian—something easy to read and without artistic flourish. Often that literary agency or publisher will make the choice for you and dictate a font style.

_**Publishing**_

If you self-publishing (printed, ebook, ePub, or blog), your choice of font (or set of fonts) widens and needs to match the overall design of the book, publication, or website. Book content design is an entire subject unto itself that I will not go into here. Maybe I will at some later date.

## TL;DR: the fonts I use

> **Spoiler alert!**
>
> <span style="font-size: 75%;">This is a long article just to say that nine times out of ten, given no other guidance, you want to choose a Times New Roman font equivalent for most stages of the revision and submission process.</span>

We'll discuss all kinds of fonts here in a second, but to keep things grounded, here are the fonts I predominantly use _at the moment_ (I change periodically) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

**For print (LibreOffice)**
* _Submission (12pt. always)_
  - Text body: TeX Gyre Termes (second choice Croscore Tinos)
    - For editors who want Arial: Croscore Arimo
    - For editors who want Helvetica: Tex Gyre Heros
    - For editors who want Calibri: Crosextra Carlito
    - For editors who want Courier (crazy people!): TeX Gyre Cursor or Noto Mono
  - Heading and Frontmatter: Surprise! Use the same font for everything.
* _Publishing_
  - Text body: EB Garamond, Cormorant Garamand Medium, Cardo (11pt), Libre Caslon Text (10pt), or Crimson Text
  - Headings: Fira Sans Book, TeX Gyre Pagella (Palantino-like), Overpass, Crosextra Carlito, Montserrat, or Avería Sans (or Serif) Libre (the Avería fonts are almost too unique).

**For print (Google Docs)**
* Submission (12pt. always): Croscore Tinos (or, see above: Arimo, Carlito, or Noto Mono)
* Publishing: Don't use Google Docs for documents targeting publication except maybe short essays or flash fiction and then only if the text doesn't need to be justified (and therefore properly hyphenated).

**For the web:** I maintain three websites using these fonts:
1. <!--tf-->Text: Cardo and Fira Mono / Headings: Fira Sans Book
2. <!--tr-->Text: Crimson Text and Fira Mono / Headings: Fira Sans Book
3. <!--er-->Text: Libre Caslon Text and Fira Mono / Headings: Avería Sans Libre<br />
   Used for select blog posts (not inclusive): Chilanka, Fira Sans Book, Crimson Text, Croscore Cursor, Overpass, Overpass Mono

## Fonts: Draft &#x27F6; Submission

### The big three: Times New Roman, Courier New, and Arial/Helvetica

**Times New Roman.** Times is a proportional serif font for which writers, editors, everyone have settled on as _the_ default standard for submission. Or just about everyone. And heck, even if self-publishing, Times is a safe and reliable font choice for your book as well. Times is a readable and reasonably attractive font.

**Courier New.** Courier is a monospace serif font that _used_ to be the standard for drafting and submission. Typewriters produced documents in courier font; therefore, manuscripts were expected to be submitted in that format. Only recently has this legacy font died off as the preferred choice of editors. We no longer use typewriters nor do we submit hard-copy manuscripts. Even that Luddite of Luddites, Wendell Berry, submits a manuscript to his publisher in digital format. He handwrites his manuscripts (in pencil) and then his wife types it up on a typewriter, then they pay someone to enter it into a word processor which then gets submitted to his agent/publisher electronically. There may be some editor out there that still prefers your manuscript be submitted in a monospaced serif font, but it's highly unlikely.

**Arial/Helvetica** Rumor has it that some editors prefer the copy be in a sans-serif font. They are crazy people, but if so, Arial (or Helvetica or Calibri) is the typical choice.

Times New Roman®, Courier New, Arial®, Helvetica®, Calibri®, etc. are trademarked brand names for a certain set of designs. Designs where the type foundries that own them (Monotype for most of these) essentially have a proprietary lock on, if not the design, the trademark (note, Courier New is somehow different in a way I don't understand).

To agents and editors, _Times New Roman_® is to default serif font as _Kleenex®_ is to nasal tissue. What they are really asking for is a highly readable, cleanly designed font that isn't distracting.

### But! But! Linux doesn't supply these fonts!

Linux users don't typically have these name-brand fonts installed. In fact, for a very long time, the selection of fonts available to the open source world were very limited—none that looked great on both the screen _and_ the page. The Linux desktop used to be full of usable, but unattractively grainy, fonts that served as poor substitutes for fonts provided by the proprietary world of Apple and Microsoft.

Boy things have changed!

Open source dominates all platforms now: mobile, web, servers, and even the the proprietary desktops of the world (Apple and Microsoft) or really hybrid open and closed source platforms. The desire for _open everything_, the availability of font design tools, and strategic corporate sponsorship has led to a blossoming of open source fonts. And on top of the list are fonts that can serve as drop-in replacements (metrically compatible) for, you guessed it, Times New Roman, Courier New, and Arial/Helvetica.

Today, the available variety of fonts is vast and of high quality. Especially for latin-based languages.

For linux, many fonts are available as packaged items&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

> * In the Gnome desktop, open the _Software_ application (gnome-software)
> * Click "Add-ons" and then "Fonts"
> * At the time of this writing (May 5th, 2020 and Fedora 31), I count 272 fonts available.

But even more can be found at or [Open Font Library](https://fontlibrary.org/), [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com), [dafont](https://www.dafont.com), and [FontSquirrel](https://fontsquirrel.com).

And with that, Times New Roman—and Courier New and Arial and the rest—have open alternatives that, I would argue, are just as mature and effective today as the ones they emulate. Some reasonable alternatives include&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
* Times New Roman &#x27F6; Liberation Serif, TeX Gyre Termes, Croscore Tinos
* Courier New &#x27F6; TeX Gyre Cursor, Nimbus Mono PS, Noto Mono  
  Courier New (but sans) &#x27F6; Croscore Cousine
* Arial &#x27F6; Croscore Arimo, Liberation Sans  
  Helvetica &#x27F6; TeX Gyre Heros  
  Calibri &#x27F6; Crosextra Carlito

> _In short: for submission of a manuscript, choose Liberation Serif, Termes, or Tinos unless you are asked to do otherwise._

**Installation on Fedora 32**
```
sudo dnf install texlive-tex-gyre* google-croscore-* google-crosextra-* google-noto-* liberation-* urw-*-nimbus-*
```

> We could stop right there for the purposes of putting together a manuscript, but, for those who want to explore some of the other fonts out there, read on. There is a whole world of nuanced fonts for publishing, whether that be to the web (blog posts and such) or print.

## More Artful Fonts for Publication and Presentation

For print and ebook publication, and content-heavy websites, you may want something more nuanced than Times New Roman. You may also want to start considering different fonts for different purposes (font pairings): headers, text body, quotations and asides, etc.

That being said, unless you really really need to make a particular statement, stick to fonts that are relatively subdued in how much they diverge from the norm rather than choosing something boldly different or bizarre. One of the most commonly cited criticism of poorly designed self-published books is that authors sometimes pick really distracting fonts. Don't do that. Err on the side of pragmatism.

### Font categories and some associated fonts

At a high level, this is how fonts are categorized.

> _<span style="font-size: 75%;">Note: I assuming a baseline font size of 12pt compared to the standard set of fonts. I annotate a pt change where I think it is appropriate for that particular font to behave similarly to the standard fonts. You may have to adjust up or down depending on how the font looks on the page or website.</span>_

#### Serif (aka Roman)

The fonts that have little decorative things at the end of the strokes used to draw them. In theory—and there is some modest science to back this claim—serif fonts are easier to read. On the printed page at least. More often than not, they are more aesthetically pleasing.

_Proportional_ — Each character takes up space that is complementary to that characters form. An _M_ will take up more horizontal space than an _I_.

_Monospace_ — Each character takes up precisely the same amount of space as any other character.

> I've ❤_highlighted_ some of my favorite fonts. It should be noted that Latin Modern fonts look reasonable on screen, but truly shine as printed fonts. Many fonts are better screen fonts than print fonts, and vice versa. Experiment!

> ***Installation of these fonts will be discussed at the end of this document.***

_**Monospace Serif fonts**_

> Note: many monospaced fonts are serif-ish or sans-serif-ish or somewhere in between. Many applications lump them all together and label them "monospaced" for this reason.

Serif fonts can be further classified: Old-style, Transitional, Didone, Slab serif, and more. We won't discuss such nuance here.

#### Sans-Serif

Fonts that are literally _sans_, or without, serif. They don't have extra decorators at the end of the stokes that define them. They can, TeX Gyre Schola (Century Schoolbook-like) be, similarly to serif fonts, proportional or monospace.

> For print, sans-serif fonts are best used for headers or blocks of specialized text mixed in with serif text. In this way the sans-serif text acts as a complementary but differentiating typeface.

#### [Cursive Script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typefaces#Script), Fancy, Brush, Calligraphic, Handwriting, Other

Cursive. There's a whole group of fonts that mimic hand-printed text, scripted text, and calligraphy. These fall into what some call the "cursive" font grouping. It's a terrible category name, but it hints at what may be included.

_**Cursive examples:**_  
TeX Gyre Choral (Zapf Chancery-like), Architects Daughter, Steve Hand, SMonohand, Grand Hotel, Serafettin Cartoon, Isabella, Chilanka, Blokletters Viltstift (comic sans-like)

Other character fonts. There a lot of subcategories that I am not going to spell out, but for now we'll call them "other." Art decco, block-characters .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all those characters that are text but very specialized and not organic (hand-written).

_**Other character fonts examples:**_  
Cormorant Unicase, Comorant SC, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Symbols. Glyphs and images that aren't letters. Emoji. Dingbats. And more. Useful for [separators and flourishes between scenes and things](https://www.thebookdesigner.com/2010/06/book-design-8-solutions-to-the-text-break-dilemma/) in stories and books. I'll let you find these on your own. :)

## Whew!

Once you have whittled down the fonts that interest you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
* Use at most two or three complementary fonts (books and websites). For a manuscript, a single font (a Times New Roman equivalent) is ideal.  
  Check out the [FontPair website](https://fontpair.co/) for ideas and inspiration.
* If it is a webpage: Zoom in and out; stretch the window; make it tall; print the webpage. What happens?
* If it is a manuscript: Print a handful of pages for each candidate font and look at them and consider: Does the font disappear from my attention when I read the page? Is it easy to read? Print a 12pt Times New Roman comparable and make sure the font size is roughly the same and the double-spacing for each are adequate.
* If it is a book: Print out a handful of pages for each candidate font and compare them to books from your bookshelf. Again, are they attractive _and_ non-distracting? Does the tone of each font fit the genre of your writing? What do other books in your genre use for their fonts, both headings and body text? And don't forget to compare your frontmatter with the frontmatter of other books.

&nbsp;  
Fonts can lead you down a path of darkness and sorrow. Be careful out there. Just make sure you are happy with the fonts you have chosen. Good luck!

## <center>Addendum</center>

### Where to find certain fonts and how to install them

#### The core metrically compatible fonts

**Desktop installation (as described previously):**
```

# TeX Gyre Termes, TeX Gyre Cursor, TeX Gyre Heros, and more
# Croscore Tinos, Croscore Cousine, Croscore Arimo, Crosextra fonts, and more
# Liberation Serif, Liberation Sans, Nimbus Mono PS, Noto Mono, and more
sudo dnf install texlive-tex-gyre* google-croscore-* google-crosextra-* google-noto-* liberation-* urw-*-nimbus-*
```

**Website availability:**

All but the TeX fonts are easy to use for any website. Just use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) or [Open Font Library](https://fontlibrary.org/). Please note that the CSS for the liberation fonts as configured by Open Font Library made them relatively inflexible. I redid the CSS and include it here for your convenience.

```
<!-- HTML -->
<!-- liberation sans and serif -->
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taw00/writing-resources/master/Artifacts/css/toddwarner-font-sans-liberation.css" type="text/css"/>
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taw00/writing-resources/master/Artifacts/css/toddwarner-font-serif-liberation.css" type="text/css"/>
<!-- Tinos (a Croscore font) -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Tinos:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

Or . . .

```
/* CSS */
/* liberation sans and serif */
@import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taw00/writing-resources/master/Artifacts/css/toddwarner-font-sans-liberation.css");
@import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taw00/writing-resources/master/Artifacts/css/toddwarner-font-serif-liberation.css");
/* Tinos (a Croscore font) */
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Tinos:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&display=swap");
```

Example configuration (web):
```
/* CSS */
p, .libserif {
  font-family: 'Liberation Serif', serif;
}

.tinosserif {
  font-family: 'Tinos', serif;
}
```

I leave it to the reader to figure out the rest. Most of the other fonts can be installed similarly. I will mention a couple others where there may be more too it than that.

#### Fira

There are two major forks of Fira and a third future Fira. All this is confusing. The Fira that is canonical is [Mozilla's Fira](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira). [bBoxType's Fira](https://github.com/bBoxType/FiraSans) is somehow a smidge different and should be avoided, IMHO (controversy?). But bBoxType is working on something called [FiraGO](https://github.com/bBoxType/FiraGO), but it is no where near completion so .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Anyway. Just use Mozilla's Fira and maybe Tonsky's Fira Code extension of Fira Mono. They can easily be utilized on the desktop via supplied OS packages and on the web via Mozilla and Tonksy directly, Google Fonts, or FontSquirrel

Direct from source (only if your OS can't supply them):
* Sans and Mono: https://github.com/mozilla/Fira
* Code: https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode

Google and FontSquirrel (only if your OS can't supply them):
* Sans: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans
* Mono: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono
* Code: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code
* Sans: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/fira-sans
* Mono: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/fira-mono
* Code: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/fira-code

**Desktop installation:**
```
# Fira Sans, Mono and Code
sudo dnf install fira-code-fonts mozilla-fira-*
```

**Web availability (add to your HTML or CSS):**
```
<!-- HTML -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://code.cdn.mozilla.net/fonts/fira.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tonsky/FiraCode@3/distr/fira_code.css">
```

Or . . .

```
/* CSS */
@import url(https://code.cdn.mozilla.net/fonts/fira.css);
@import url(https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tonsky/FiraCode@3/distr/fira_code.css);
```

Example configuration (web):
```
p { font-family: 'Fira Sans', sans-serif; }
code { font-family: 'Fira Code', monospace; }
@supports (font-variation-settings: normal) {
  code { font-family: 'Fira Code VF', monospace; }
}
```

Or, if you are like me, and on a webpage you prefer straight-up Fira Mono:
```
p { font-family: 'Fira Sans', sans-serif; }
code { font-family: 'Fira Mono', monospace; }
```

#### Cardo

You can get old versions of Cardo from Google and FontSquirrel but there is a newer version at the designer's website. It hasn't been updated since 2011 so .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the designer may have abandoned it or die or something. Regardless, I like the font.

**For Desktop:**
* Download the font from http://www.scholarsfonts.net/cardofnt.html
* Then ...  
  ```
  cd ~/.fonts/
  mkdir cardo ; cd cardo
  mv ~/Download/cardo104.zip ./
  unzip *.zip
  rm Cardoi99.ttf Cardob101.ttf
  fc-cache -vfr
  ```

**For the web:**  
_Just use the dated Google fonts. They are not noticeably different to me._

```
<!-- HTML -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cardo:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

Or . . .

```
/* CSS */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cardo:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400&display=swap');
```

Example configuration (web):
```
/* CSS */
p { font-family: Cardo, serif; }
```

#### Avería

Avería is a wickedly cool set of fonts. [The designer][averiawebsite] essentially developed the fonts by averaging many popular fonts and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. boom! Avería was born. It makes for a smooshy, but attractive print that looks good for many things, but will not be right for all projects. I particularly like the font for headings, though for text it looks interesting as well.

[averiawebsite]: http://iotic.com/averia/ "Designer's Website for Avería"

**For Desktop:**
* Download the fonts from https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Averia+Serif+Libre and https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Averia+Sans+Libre
* Then ...  
  ```
  cd ~/.fonts/
  mkdir averia ; cd averia
  mkdir serif sans
  mv ~/Download/Averia_Serif_Libre.zip ./serif/
  mv ~/Download/Averia_Sans_Libre.zip ./sans/
  unzip ./serif/Averia_Serif_Libre.zip  -d ./serif/
  unzip ./sans/Averia_Sans_Libre.zip  -d ./sans/
  fc-cache -vfr
  ```

**For the web:**  

```
<!-- HTML -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Averia+Serif+Libre:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,700;1,300;1,400;1,700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Averia+Sans+Libre:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,700;1,300;1,400;1,700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

Or . . .

```
/* CSS */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Averia+Serif+Libre:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,700;1,300;1,400;1,700&display=swap');
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Averia+Sans+Libre:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,700;1,300;1,400;1,700&display=swap');
```

Example configuration (web):
```
/* CSS */
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { font-family: 'Averia Sans Libre', sans-serif; }
p { font-family: 'Averia Serif Libre', serif; }
```

The fonts can also be found here: [serif](https://fontlibrary.org/face/averia-serif) and [sans serif](https://fontlibrary.org/face/averia-sans)
