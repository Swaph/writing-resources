# How to Format a Manuscript for a Novel or Short Story or Poetry

First of all, your agent will inform you what is needed for submission to a
specific publisher (and some have their standards posted) but having your story
preformatted in what is considered a typical manuscript format will get you
nine-tenths of the way to the finish line.

> It should be noted, that today, agents, editors, and publishers expect an
editable document sent to them (a digital document). It is usually passed back
and forth over email. Many still accepted paper manuscripts less than 15 years
ago, maybe 10. In the near future, it is my suspicion (see _predictions_ at the
end of this) that editors will begin to accept live cloud documents. If that is
the case, some of this stuff gets easier. That being said, there is value in
being able to format things appropriately regardless of what tool you are
using. The general format doesn't change much.

The format: Thus far, this is the cleanest and most succinct website on the
topic: <https://format.ms/story> or <https://www.shunn.net/format/story/>. Also
check out his [Novel](https://www.shunn.net/format/novel/) and
[Poetry](https://www.shunn.net/format/poetry/) formating examples.

In summation, when formatting your short story or novel for submission, you are trying to . . .
1. Be consistent and readable.
2. Make it easy for an editor to mark things up.
3. Avoid formatting that distracts.

The format is not _rigid_ per ce, but this is for editorial review, not
pleasure reading. You want to take a utilitarian approach. With that in mind,
follow these guidelines and you will likely have something that only needs
minor adjustment in order to meet the specs for whomever you are working with.

## Generally guidance for English manuscripts in the USA

A good description is here as well: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_manuscript_format>

* Page-dimensions: letter-sized (8.5 inches by 11 inches)
* Margins: Standard sized margins. 1-inch margins (all margins) is typical.
* Font: 12pt Times New Roman (or it's equivalent) is the modern standard.
* Some publishers will want Ariel or Courier New (or their equivalents). Don't
  get fancy with the fonts. More on that topic in another document.
* Color: black text
* Spacing: double or 1.5 spacing
* Paragraph slignment: left (ragged right)
* Paragraph indentation: 0.5 inches or there abouts
* Sentence spacing: a single space between sentences. Some agents and
  publishing houses don't care, but some do, so err on the side of what is
  standard: a single space between sentences. If you are submitting in courier
  font, you have an argument otherwise, but it is safer to go the single-space
  route. See also, ["The Space Between (sentences)"](https://errantruminant.com/blog/twospaces/).
* Electronic copy: The [Office Open XML Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML):
  `.docx` (aka, MS Word format) unless specified otherwise. (Science publishers may require TeX or
  LaTeX, but we are talking mostly fiction here.)
* First page: includes contact information, approximate word count, title, and
  byline. Perhaps audience (category), genre, and document version (depending
  on who the recipient of the manuscript is).
* Style: [Chicago Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicago_Manual_of_Style)
* Emphasized text: if you mean to italicize something, italicize it. The days
  of underlining, just like the days of two-spaces between sentences, are over
  (unless the publisher says differently).
* Don't use the tab key or space bar to indent paragraphs. Use styles to
  properly format the indentation by default.


## Additionally, for both Short Story and Novel Manuscripts
* In the header, on the upper right, on pages two and onward: Surname / Running
  Title / Page Number
* Parts and Chapters: start a new page, about one-third of the way from the
  top, centered. Still 12pt and normal capitalization.  Note: Some will want
chapters formatted in various ways to include all-caps and how the chapter name
is formatted and positioned.
* Scenes: a single 12pt '#' centered, between two paragraphs.
* First paragraph after a Part, Chapter, or Scene: pick one: either indented or
  not indented. Just be consistent. This will likely be spelled out by the
  publisher. When in doubt, indent. This has been the standard for hundreds of
  years, but some publishers will say to simply indent it.
* End of story mark: At the end, include a [thirty mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-30-).
  "###" or "# # #"for a short story and "The End" for a novel. 12pt, centered.

## Additionally, for Short Story manuscripts
* Story begins right after the byline on the first page. There is extra spacing between the byline and the story.
* Page two is really page two and should be numbered as such, i.e., the story begins on the title page.

## Additionally, for Noval manuscripts
* The novel text begins on the second page a third of the way down the page regardless if it starts with a part or chapter marker.
* Page two is really page one and should be numbered as such.
