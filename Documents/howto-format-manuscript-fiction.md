# How to Format a Manuscript for a Novel or Short Story or Poetry

First of all, your agent will inform you what is needed for submission to a
specific publisher (and some have their standards posted) but having your story
pre-formatted in what is considered a typical manuscript format will get you
nine-tenths of the way to the finish line.

In summation, when formatting your short story or novel for submission, you are trying to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
1. Be consistent and readable.
2. Make it easy for an editor to mark things up.
3. Avoid formatting that distracts.

* Page-dimensions: letter-sized (8.5 inches by 11 inches)
* Margins: at least 1-inch margins (all margins)
* Font:
  - 12pt. Black.
  - Times New Roman (or it's equivalent). Read more about fonts in [On Fonts](on-fonts.md)
  - Some publishers will want Ariel or Courier New (or their equivalents). See
    the previously mentioned _On Fonts_ document.
* Spacing: double-ish. 1.5 spacing may be fine.
* Paragraph alignment: left (ragged right)
* Hyphenation: turn off auto-hyphenation
* Paragraph indentation: 0.5 inches or there-abouts
* Sentence spacing: a single space between sentences. Some agents and
  publishing houses don't care, but most do, so err on the side of what is
  standard: a single space between sentences. If you are submitting in courier
  font, you have an argument to do otherwise, but it is safer to go the
  single-space route. See also,
  ["The Space Between (sentences)"](https://errantruminant.com/blog/twospaces/).
* Electronic copy: If they ask for `.docx`, ask if they are okay with a `.odt`
  (if using LibreOffice), or if you are using Google Docs, ask if they are okay
  with a link to document. If they are adamant, "Save As..." (LibreOffice) or
  "Download" (Google Docs). Science publishers may require TeX or LaTeX, but we
  are talking mostly fiction here.
* First page (see example PDFs in the [Artifacts](../Artifacts) folder)
  - contact information
  - approximate word count
  - title and byline
  - perhaps audience (category) and genre
  - document version (depending on who the recipient of the manuscript is).
* Header on 2nd page onward: Surname / Running Title / Page Number
* Style: [Chicago Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicago_Manual_of_Style)
* Emphasized text: if you mean to italicize something, italicize it. The days
  of underlining, just like the days of two-spaces between sentences, are over
  (unless the publisher says differently).
* Don't use the tab key or space bar to indent paragraphs. Use styles to
  properly format the indentation by default.
* Parts and Chapters  start a new page, about one-third of the way from the
  top, centered. Still 12pt and normal capitalization (unless stated otherwise).
* Scenes: a single 12pt '#' centered, between two paragraphs.
* First paragraph after a Part, Chapter, or Scene: pick one: either indented or
  not indented. Just be consistent. This will likely be spelled out by the
  publisher. This has been the standard for hundreds of years, but some
  publishers will say to simply indent it. If it is too hard for you to do, just
  indent it.
* End of story mark (the "Thirty"): At the end, include a
  [thirty mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-30-). "###" or "# # #"for a short
  story and "The End" for a novel. 12pt, centered.
* Short Story:
  - The story begins right after the byline on the first page. There can be
    extra spacing between the byline and the story.
  - Page two is really page two and should be numbered as such, i.e., the story
    begins on the title page.
* Novel:
  - The novel text begins on the second page a third of the way down the page
    regardless if it starts with a part or chapter marker.
  - Page two is really page one and should be numbered as such. I.e., the story
    text starts on the 2nd page of the manuscript.

That's it! That's the summary of how a manuscript is formatted. For LibreOffice
specifics, I encourage you to read
[Using LibreOffice for Manuscript Formatting and Development](howto-manuscript-libreoffice.md). For Google Doc specifics, I encourage you to visit
