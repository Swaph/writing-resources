# My writing process (in tools)

## Summary
##### Development:  
[Draft0: pen &amp; paper]  
&#8199;&#8199;-> [Revision: Joplin or Google Docs or OpenOffice Writer]  
&#8199;&#8199;&#8199;&#8199;-> [Submission: OpenOffice Writer or Google Docs]

I delay working in a word processor or layout engine for as long as possible and work with either pen &amp; paper or a [markdown editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

Only then do I migrate to something that will produce "prettier" or formatted output.

## Self-publication:  
_Note: I haven't self-published (books) in years, so I am still exploring that side of things._
- Physical (books, static PDF): LaTeX or OpenOffice Writer
- Digital (ePub, etc.): Reedsy Book Editor? Overleaf?
- Blog: Cut-n-paste (from Joplin) into blog editor as markdown; review; post.
- Poems (static PDF): OpenOffice Writer or LyX

## Archiving: I store everything in multiple places
I am terrified of losing things. I _have_ lost things in the past. Therefore, I am paranoid. Here's where I store things:
1. All copies in a directory on the hard drive `~/Work/Writing/name-of-writing-project/`
2. In the Joplin application (encrypted and synced to Dropbox). I configure Joplin to store everything in a similar structure as the file system.
3. I similarly mirror everything in Google Drive
4. And I periodically back up my laptop.
5. Redundancy galore! And you will still screw up and lose something.

## My prediction for the future
In ten years or less (_some of this is already happening_)&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
* Most revision will be in the cloud
* Manuscript submissions will be a Google Doc link or similar
* Online word processors will advance to the revile their desktop anagrams
* Free or affordable cloud-based typesetting will revile the desktop-based LaTeXes and InDesigns of the world in quality of output
* Online and Offline tools will blur
* Most of the templates and instruction I offer here will become moot
