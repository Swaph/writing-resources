As I develop a new project, I delay working in a word processor or layout engine for as long as possible. I generally work with either pen &amp; paper or a [markdown editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) in the early stages.

Once the project is starting to settle, only then do I migrate to something that will produce "prettier" or a more traditional, formatted artifact. Often I will wait until the project is largely complete.

## Self-publication

_Disclaimer: I haven't self-published anything besides blog articles in years, so I am still exploring that side of things._

- Physical (books, static PDF): OpenOffice Writer or LyX/LaTeX. Scribus? Inkscape for art?
- Digital (ePub, etc.): Calibre? Reedsy Book Editor? Overleaf?
- Poems (static PDF): OpenOffice Writer or LyX/LaTeX
- Blog: Cut-n-paste (from Joplin) into blog editor as markdown; review; post.

## Archiving: I store everything in multiple places

I am terrified of losing things. I _have_ lost things in the past. Therefore, I am paranoid. Here's where I store things:
1. All copies in a directory on the hard drive `~/Work/Writing/name-of-writing-project/`
2. In the Joplin application (encrypted and synced to Dropbox). I configure Joplin to store everything in a similar structure as the file system.
3. I similarly mirror everything in Google Drive
4. And I periodically back up my laptop.
5. Redundancy galore! And you will still screw up and lose something.

## Tools

> <span style="font-size: 75%;">It's probably worth noting if it's not obvious, as a creator, you can use whatever tools you like. But once you start working with someone else, you use whatever gets the job done based on both of your requirements. For example, I am doing freelance editing work at the moment (May 2020) and my client works in [reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText). Throughout our interaction, the document never leaves that format, even though that is not a typical set of tools that I use.</span>

- Pen &amp; paper  
  I draft heavily with pen and paper (draft0). Current favorites .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
  - Notebooks: For journaling I like the [Exceed A5 Bullet Journal](https://stationerynerd.com/newexceed/). For novel writing I am using [Pen+Gear Leatherette 7"x9.5"](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Pen-Gear-Leatherette-Cover-Journal-192-Ruled-Pages-Black-or-Brown-7-x-9-5/366407550) notebooks. Both can be found at Walmart. Go figure.
  - [Parker Jotter Gel](https://www.amazon.com/Parker-Jotter-Black-Chrome-Medium/dp/B071SLHS5L) — I love this pen. It's my primary pen for everything. You can find it in lots of place.
  - Pilot G2 Gel (red ink) — I use this for marking up when I edit or add notes to text.
- [Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.com)  
  Since 1995 or 1996, Linux has been my desktop.
- [Markdown](https://joplinapp.org/markdown/)-based editors / document management platforms  
  - [Joplin](https://joplinapp.com/)  
    Joplin is at its core a markdown editor. But it also can be used to store just about anything while syncing between desktop and mobile, end-to-end encrypted. I maintain Fedora-friendly [Joplin packages](https://github.com/taw00/joplin-rpm) as a member of the open source Joplin community.
  - [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [GhostWriter](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/) and [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- Word processors
  - [LibreOffice Writer](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/) and [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)  
  Used for Used for revision and preparation for submission-ready drafts.
- Typesetting and Layout engines
  - [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/) and [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
    For self-publishing print-ready books and static PDFs. EPubs are possible, but beyond my ability right now.
- Manuals of style—_professionalize your prose_  
  - [Chicago Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicago_Manual_of_Style)
  - [The Associated Press (AP) Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/)
- Experimenting:  
  [Manuskript](http://www.theologeek.ch/manuskript/), [oStorybook](https://ostorybook.tuxfamily.org),  [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/), [Kile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kile), [Reedsy Book Editor](https://reedsy.com/write-a-book), and more.


## My prediction for the future

In ten years or less (_some of this is already happening_)&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
* Most revision will be in the cloud
* Manuscript submissions will be a Google Doc link or similar
* Online word processors will advance to the revile their desktop anagrams
* Free or affordable cloud-based typesetting will revile the desktop-based LaTeXes and InDesigns of the world in quality of output
* Online and Offline tools will blur
* Most of the templates and instruction I offer here will become moot
