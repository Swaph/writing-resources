!README.Project

Your project. Every project would have their own number and duplicate this structure.

Project 1, Novel — Saeculum<br />&emsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Project 2, Short — Give or Take an Inch<br />&emsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

See below for a summary of the structure.

## WHEN YOU ARE READY START A NEW PROJECT, DO THIS (an export and an import):

...in Joplin desktop app...

1. Right click on `Project 0, Short|Novel — Story Name`
2. Export > MD - Markdown<br />This exports only that notebook.
3. Pick some place to save it temporarily

...on the filesystem...

4. Browse to your operating system and
5. Change the name (on the filesystem) from `Project 0 ...` to your project requirements, maybe `Project 1, Short — Give or Take an Inch` (an example of a short story of mine).

...back in the Joplin desktop app...

6. File > Import > MD - Markdown (Directory)
7. Drag-and-Drop the imported `Project 1` tree into the `Writing Projects` notebook.
8. Check that everything was imported as you expected

...back on the filesystem...

9. Delete the exported project directory _and_ the `_resources` directory
10. Start working on your project! Super easy.
