Scene ACT.SCENE — SCENE TITLE (template)

> <small>This is a simple scene card that I like to use quite a bit. Sometimes it gets expanded into something more complex. The card's name is numbered by act and scene, so for example: `Scene 1.1 — Burying a Body`. This says, Act 1, Scene 1, title 'Burying a Body'. And this scene card would live in the `Act 1` sub-notebook.</small>

Title: Scene Title Here

Where: Location of scene

Who: POV Character and any other characters of importance

Summary: Beginning, Middle, and End narrative summary of the scene.

Purpose: What is the purpose of this scene. How does it ride the "third rail" as story expert Lisa Cron likes to say (_Story Genius_).
