!README.Ideas

This folder is a dumping ground for ideas specific to your writing projects. Click "New note" and go explore your idea. I also have a note named `!SCRATCH` that I scribble random ideas, but once those ideas start to flesh out, I put them in their own note. Note: the exclamation point ensures the note is ordered on top of the list.
