!README.Scene Cards

> Refer to `!README.Project` in the `Project 0 ...` notebook for context and overall description.

Within each `Act X` you will create _scene cards_ each of which describe and summarize one scene. I like to think of a card as being the size of an index card and I try to keep the desciption short, but expressive.
