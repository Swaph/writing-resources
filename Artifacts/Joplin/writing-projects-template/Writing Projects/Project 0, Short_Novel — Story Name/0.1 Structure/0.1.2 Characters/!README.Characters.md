!README.Characters

There are a lot of ways to keep track of your characters. The way I prefer to do so is to track all characters in one document and then have a seperate document for each character that describes them in more depth. It's not rocket science, but you need to identify character motivations, past conflict and background, and really spell out their internal conflicts.

So, keep it simple. One document called `Character Summary` and then a document for each. Even for most of the smaller characters.
