## Project Artifacts!

Generated PDFs, the combined markdown, LibreOffice Manuscript versions, the finalized PDF, epub, mobi file, etc. All that stuff, would go in here.

I would probably also stick in here items I sent other people: query letters, stuff I sent to my agent, etc. If you need to, feel free to create additional sub-notebooks.

The way you story miscellaneous (non-markdown) files is to create a normal note and attached a file. Kinda like you would an email. I have demonstrated this with an example document called `Manuscripts`
