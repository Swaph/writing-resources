## The Writing Projects sub-notebook

For all my writing projects, I have this one mega-notebook (folder) entitled "Writing Projects". Within, I have a sub-notebook for each type of activity. My longer projects get their own Project sub-notebook, each with their own stack of sub-notebooks. The tree of one project will look something like this (note that Saeculum is the working title of my novel):
