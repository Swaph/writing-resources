!README.Writing Projects

> **Important note:** In order to view the structure of the "Writing Projects" notebook tree in the way I intended, you have to set two options in the Joplin menus as such:
> 1. View > Sort notes by > Title
> 2. View > Sort notebooks by > Title

## The Writing Projects sub-notebook

For all my writing projects, I have this one mega-notebook (folder) entitled `Writing Projects`. Within, I have a sub-notebook for each type of activity: `Blogs — xxxx`, `Poetry`, etc. My longer or more involved projects get their own `Project #` sub-notebook, each with their own structure of activity. 

Please take a look at the `!README.Project` document in the `Project 0, Short|Novel — Short Name` notebook template.
