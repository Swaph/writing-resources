# How to Use Joplin to Maintain Your Blog

This is an example blog post. It's a terrible example, but it is an example of how I write and maintain my blogs. That's all I really have to say about that. All my blog posts are written and maintained in Joplin in the [markdown format](https://joplinapp.org/markdown/).

I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
1. Draft the entry in Joplin, and even insert any images in the right places in the document.
2. I cut-n-past and do whatever I need to do to post to my blog.
3. If I need to edit it over time (I always do), I edit it here in Joplin and then,
4. Re-post the changes in the blog.
