!README.Blog

I draft all my blog entries in Joplin and then transfer the text to my blog. I actually contribute to three blogs, and thus have a _Blog — Blog Named X_ and a _Blog — Blog Named Y_ etc. Each document, a "New note" (see menu) is saved as "DATE — SHORT TITLE", for example: "2020-05-24 — How to Use Joplin to Maintain Your Blog"
