!README.Blog

I draft all my blog entries in Joplin and then transfer the text to my blog. I actually contribute to three blogs, and thus have a `Blog — Blog Named X` and a `Blog — Blog Named Y` etc. Each document, a "New note" (see menu) is saved as `DATE — TITLE`, for example: `2020-05-24 — How to Use Joplin to Maintain Your Blog`
