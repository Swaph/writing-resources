# Writing Resources

_**open source and freely available tools and configuration for writers**_

I write.

I write short stories, novels, and poetry. I blog. I freelance edit and I have contributed to an online news outlets and such in the past. I sometimes collaborate with others.

I do all this on a Fedora Linux desktop and in the cloud. Over time I have adopted patterns and technologies that I figured I should share with others. So, here you go.

## What's in this GitHub repo?

* Documents: tips-n-tricks, configuration, howtos, etc.
* Artifacts: templates, examples, all in support of the stuff in the Documents folder.  

## Tools discussed
- Pen &amp; paper  
  I draft heavily with pen and paper (draft0). Current favorites .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
  - Notebooks: For journaling I like the [Exceed A5 Bullet Journal](https://stationerynerd.com/newexceed/). For novel writing I am using [Pen+Gear Leatherette 7"x9.5"](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Pen-Gear-Leatherette-Cover-Journal-192-Ruled-Pages-Black-or-Brown-7-x-9-5/366407550) notebooks. Both can be found at Walmart. Go figure.
  - [Parker Jotter Gel](https://www.amazon.com/Parker-Jotter-Black-Chrome-Medium/dp/B071SLHS5L) — I love this pen. It's my primary pen for everything. You can find it in lots of place.
  - Pilot G2 Gel (red ink) — I use this for marking up when I edit or add notes to text.
- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.com/)  
  Joplin is at its core a [markdown editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). But it also can be used to store just about anything while syncing between desktop and mobile, end-to-end encrypted.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [GhostWriter](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/) and [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)  
  Additional editors I used to edit markdown.
- [LibreOffice Writer](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/) and [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)  
  Used for Used for revision and preparation for submission-ready drafts.
- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/) and [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
  For self-publishing print-ready books and static PDFs. EPubs are possible, but beyond my ability right now.
- System configuration (Linux, predominantly)
- [Chicago Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicago_Manual_of_Style)
  - Ellipsis, Em-dash, Commas, and more.
  - Citations, Footnotes, Endnotes, and more.
- Markdown and [reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText
- Experiments: [Manuskript](http://www.theologeek.ch/manuskript/), [oStorybook](https://ostorybook.tuxfamily.org),  [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/), [Kile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kile), [Reedsy Book Editor](https://reedsy.com/write-a-book), and more.

## What's _not_ in this GitHub repo?

- Discussion of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  
  [Scrivener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrivener_(software)), [Novlr](https://novlr.org/), [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/), [Vellum](https://vellum.pub/), [Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word), [Publisher](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/publisher), [InDesign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_InDesign), [QuarkExpress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuarkXPress),  or [Framemaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_FrameMaker). They may be mentioned in passing or in general statements.
- [Abiword](https://www.abisource.com/)  
  Abiword has been on life support for a decade or more. It is useful for certain things, but LibreOffice put a stake in Abiword's heart. Maybe someday someone will make Abiword relevant again.
- [Docbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook)  
  I have worked with docbook in the past, but I don't think it fits for this kind of writing. I may mention it in passing.
- Advanced typesetting guidance.  
  I am an amateur here. But I will do my best to ensure anything I state is accurate.
- Guidance for using any of the self-publishing platforms.  
  Maybe someday this will be added, but I am avoiding it for now. Instead do your own research. I used to work for [Lulu.com](https://www.lulu.com/) in a prior life and they are quite good, otherwise, [Joanna Penn](https://www.thecreativepenn.com/) is the queen of self-publishing. Subscribe to her podcast and review her site. She knows what she is talking about.
- Audiobooks. I know nothing about audiobooks (but Ms. Penn does, see above).
- Thoughts on query letters and the publishing process. Not yet anyway.
- Thoughts on submission to literary journals and the like.
