# Writing Resources

_**On writing with open-source software and inexpensive cloud services.**_

I write.

I write short stories, novels, and poetry. I blog. I freelance write and edit and I have contributed to online news outlets and such in the past. I sometimes collaborate with others.

I do all this as a [Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/) desktop user and by leveraging inexpensive cloud services. Over time I have adopted patterns, configurations, and technologies that have made my life easier. I figured others might benefit from my experiences, and maybe others have contributions they would like to share as well. Thus, this GitHub repo was born.

> not run on Fedora Linux or the cloud, I will probably discuss it (see below).

## What's in this GitHub repo?

* [Documents](./Documents): howtos, tips-n-tricks, configurations, etc.
* [Artifacts](./Artifacts): templates, examples, css, all in support of the
  stuff in the Documents folder.  

## What's _not_ in this GitHub repo?

- Discussion of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  
  [Scrivener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrivener_(software)), [Novlr](https://novlr.org/), [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/), [Vellum](https://vellum.pub/), [Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word), [Publisher](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/publisher), [InDesign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_InDesign), [QuarkExpress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuarkXPress), [Framemaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_FrameMaker), and the like. They may be mentioned in passing or in general statements.
- [Abiword](https://www.abisource.com/)  
  Abiword has been on life support for a decade or more. It is useful for certain things, but LibreOffice put a stake in poor Abiword's heart. Maybe someday someone will make Abiword relevant again.
- [Docbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook)  
  I have worked with docbook in the past, but I don't think it fits for this kind of writing. I may mention it in passing.
- _Advanced_ typesetting guidance.  
  I am an amateur here. But I will do my best to ensure anything I state is accurate.
- Self-publishing guidance (at least at this time).  
  I'm no expert. Do your own research. I hear lots of good things about a lot of providers—Lulu, BookBaby, Kobo, and others. In the past, there was Lulu and really no one else. The field has widened. [Joanna Penn](https://www.thecreativepenn.com/) is the queen of self-publishing. Subscribe to her podcast and review her site. She knows what she is talking about.
- Audiobooks.  
  I know nothing about audiobooks (but Ms. Penn does, see above).
- Thoughts on query letters and the publishing process. Not yet anyway.
- Thoughts on submission to literary journals and the like.

Write well.
