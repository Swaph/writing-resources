# Writing Resources

_**On being a writer in a world of open-source software and inexpensive cloud services.**_

I write.

I write short stories, novels, and poetry. I blog. I freelance write and edit. I am a past contributor to an online news outlet. I sometimes collaborate with others.

But I'm also a advocate for open source software and have for 25 years. My desktop of choice is [Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/) and I do all my work using a mix of open source and cloud-based services.

### Let me share my tools, templates, and how-tos

Over time I have adopted patterns, configurations, and technologies that have made my life easier. Occasionally, I put pen to paper, so to speak, and share my experiences with others. Some time ago, I started an [IT how-to](https://github.com/taw00/howto) repository. And now, I aim to do the same but focused on writing. Thus, this GitHub repo was born.

The objective of this repository is to be a dumping ground of how-tos for writers who prefer to work using free and open source tools. I'm not entirely sure of the scope of this just yet, but for now, it will merely reflect the tools and experiences I bring to the table. I like to experiment, and therefore, it will not be limited to pure open source. I will definitely be coming at it from a Linux-first perspective, though many of the tips and tricks will apply to anyone using the same tools on any desktop platform.

I hope you find this valuable, and I invite all of you to send me corrections and suggestions. Thanks!

## What's in this GitHub repo?

* The [Documents](./Documents) folder. &nbsp; _Go here now_.<br />
  How-tos, tips-n-tricks, configurations, etc. How I  leverage LibreOffice to format a manuscript. My thoughts on Google Docs. How I use Joplin for draft development. A discussion of fonts. How I set up a Linux machine to make typing em dashes and Chicago-style ellipses far easier. And much more.<br />
  &nbsp;
* The [Artifacts](./Artifacts) folder.<br />
  Templates, example manuscripts, and CSS in support of everything articulated in the Documents folder.

Write well.<br />

## <center>Addendum</center>

### What's _not yet_ discussed in this GitHub Repo?
- [LyX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyx), the graphical frontend for [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), which is the document processing frontend for [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX), the world-class typesetting engine.
- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), an online LaTeX service which looks pretty slick.
- The [Reedsy Book Editor](https://reedsy.com/write-a-book) for book preparation, in particular ebooks.
- [WPS Office](https://www.wps.com/), a competitor to LibreOffice.
- [Zoho Workplace](https://www.zoho.com/workplace/?src=zoho-home&ireft=ohome) is a cloud-based competitor to Google Docs (and so much more). [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/) offers a TON of tools, primarily aimed at the business community.
- [Trelby](https://www.trelby.org/) is a neat screenplay composer.
- [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) for ebook development. I have heard mixed reviews about this.
- Services such as [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/), [Trello](https://trello.com), [Keybase](https://keybase.io) Filesystem ([kbfs](https://book.keybase.io/docs/files)), and even how I use [Signal](https://signal.org/) in my writing process.
- Image manipulate: [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). I use both pretty extensively. Until I put together some advice on using them .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. GIMP is for photo manipulation and Inkscape for vector graphic (svg) development (print-ready images for publication).

### What's _not_ discussed in this GitHub repo?

- [Scrivener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrivener_(software)), [Novlr](https://novlr.org/), [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/), [Vellum](https://vellum.pub/), [Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word), [Publisher](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/publisher), [InDesign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_InDesign), [QuarkExpress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuarkXPress), [Framemaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_FrameMaker), and the like. But they may be mentioned in passing or in general statements.
- [Abiword](https://www.abisource.com/)  
  At one point in time, Abiword was the darling of the open source community. But today the project is on life support, and has been for a decade or more. It is useful for certain things, but LibreOffice put a stake in poor Abiword's heart. Maybe someday someone will make Abiword relevant again.
- [DocBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook)  
  I have worked with docbook in the past, but I don't think it fits for this kind of writing. I may mention it in passing. But who knows? If I ever do serious technical writing again, maybe I will revisit this topic.
- Advanced typesetting guidance.  
  I am an amateur when it comes to typesetting, but I will do my best to ensure anything I state is accurate.
- Self-publishing guidance (at least for now).  
  I'm no expert. Do your own research. I hear lots of good things about a lot of providers—Lulu, BookBaby, Kobo, and others. In the past, there was Lulu and really no one else. The field has widened. [Joanna Penn](https://www.thecreativepenn.com/) is the queen of self-publishing. Subscribe to her podcast and review her site. She knows what she is talking about.
- Audiobooks.  
  I know nothing about audiobooks (but Ms. Penn does, see above).
- Thoughts on query letters and the publishing process. Not yet anyway.
- Thoughts on submission to literary journals and the like. You are more likely to see a discussion on this topic on my blog, [Ruminations](https://errantruminant.com/blog/).
