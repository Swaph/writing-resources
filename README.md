# Writing Resources  
# _open source and freely available tools and configuration for writers_

I write.

I write short stories, novels, and poetry. I blog. I freelance edit and I used to contribute to an online news outlet. I sometimes collaborate with others.

I do all this on a Fedora Linux desktop and in the cloud. Over time I have adopted patterns and technologies that I figured I should share with others. So, here you go.

## What's in this github repo?

* Documents:
  - Manuscript examples
  - TBD: HowTos: tips and tricks and configurations that just make life easier
    - Em-dash made easy (—)
    - Chicago-style ellisis (. . .)
  - TBD: Joplin usage
  - TBD: Font advice
  - TBD: Style discussion and summary
* LibreOffice artifacts: templates, example documents, and discussion
* TBD: Google Docs artifacts: example documents and discussion
* TBD: LaTeX artifacts: LaTeX and LyX Document Classes and Layouts and discussion.  
  Perhaps example docs (LyX has been fighting me and the existing manuscript Document Class / Layouts kinda suck).

## What's not in this github repo?

* Anything about Scrivener or Vellum or Word or anything that Fedora Linux doesn't run (except maybe in passing)
* Super super advanced typesetting advice. I am an amateur here. But I will try to collate things as I organize things.


## My writing process (in tools)

### Summary
Fiction development: pen &amp; paper (draft0) -> Joplin or Google Docs or OO Writer (revision) -> OpenOffice Writer (submission)  
Fiction self-publication: LaTeX or OpenOffice Writer (PDF), Reedsy Book Editor or ??? for ePub

### How I write—Blog articles (or short, informally-typeset things)
1. Drafted and maintained in Joplin
2. Published to blog

### How I write Poetry (or short things with interesting structure)
1. Draft . . . wherever (back on napkin, notebooks, etc.)
2. Draft one is typed into Joplin (and core copy is maintained forever there)
3. Publishable version is created in either:
   * LibreOffice Writer
   * LyX (LaTeX)

### How I write—Short Stories (or short things)
* See "How I write—Novels"

### How I write—Novels (or long things)
1. Draft zero is handwritten (this may not happen with every project)
2. Revision cycles happen in one or more of these tools . . .
   * Markdown editor: Joplin
   * Cloud-based word processor: Google Docs
   * Desktop word processor: LibreOffice Writer
3. Review copy (sent to beta readers) is one of . . .
   * PDF produced by Google Docs or LibreOffice Writer or Joplin
   * Google Docs comment-only link
4. Publish-ready (if self-publishing) is produced (PDF) with one of . . .
   * LaTex (possibly LyX managed)
   * LibreOffice Writer
   * Some ePub tool? I have not tackled this yet. Reedsy Book Editor looks like a contender.

### Archiving—I store everything in multiple places
1. All copies in a directory on the harddrive `~/Work/Writing/name-of-writing-project/`
2. In the Joplin application (encrypted and synced to Dropbox). I configure Joplin to store everything in a similar structure as the filesystem.
3. I similarly mirror everything in Google Drive
4. And I periodically back up my laptop.
5. Redundancy galore! And you will still screw up and lose something.

## Commentary on all the tools out there

There are drafting tools that do nothing but help you organize and write. And then there are tools that you can use to ready your work for submission (manuscript preparation). And then there are tools that produce publishable artifacts. Here are my list of things I see out there. I have tried many, but not all. Some are not available for Linux.

### Drafting tools
* pen and paper. Notebooks and pens I like:
  * Pen+Gear Leatherette notebook (WalMart)
  * Parker Jotter Gel pen (for writing)
  * Pilot G2 Gel, red ink (for annotations)
* Joplin  
  Joplin is an Evernote-like tool. The editor is all markdown and it can sync to cloud storage (like Dropbox) and encrypt everything end-to-end.
* Desktop markdown editors: GhostWriter, Atom, etc.
* Desktop text editors: vim, Atom, GEdit
* Structured editors: Manuskript, oStorybook, Joplin
* Writer specific structured editors: Manuskript, oStorybook
* Word processors: LibreOffice . . .  
  LibreOffice is really the only choice. AbiWord is so dated. I haven't tried WPS or another of the other random ones out there (if they still exist).
* Online word processors: Google Docs . . .  
  Google Docs is king here. I know that an online version of Word exists, but I haven't tried it. Google Docs is great for drafting.

### Submission-readying tools (manuscripts submission)
* The word processors (desktop and online) mentioned aboved
* The typesetting packages mentioned next, though they really are overkill

### Publishing tools
* Typesetting platforms: LaTeX, InDesign, QuarkExpress, (see also Overleaf)
* Desktop word processors (though they are only modest typesetting tools): LibreOffice  
  Important: Google Docs is not good enough for professional quality published things.
* Online:
  - Novlr and Reedsy Book Editor do a good job, or so I have heard. I have not used either (yet).  
    And really, for certain things, like ePub development, you need specialized
    tools to do it correctly. Tools like the Reedsy Book Editor can simplify that
    for you (plus the typesetting for an ePub is less onerous).

## My prediction for the future
In ten years—heck, maybe five years or less for some of this . . .
* Most revision will be in the cloud
* Manuscript submissions will be a Google Doc link, or similar
* Online word processors will advance to the revile their desktop anagrams
* Free or affordable cloud-based typesetting will revile the LaTeXed and InDesigns of the world in quality of output
* Online and Offline tools will blur
* Most of these templates and notes in this repo will become moot (could happen sooner than later)
