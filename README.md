# Writing Resources

_**On being a writer in a world of open-source software and inexpensive cloud services.**_

I write.

I write short stories, novels, and poetry. I blog. I freelance write and edit. I am a past contributor to an online news outlet. I sometimes collaborate with others.

But I'm also a advocate for open source software and have been for 25 years. My desktop of choice is [Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/) and I do all my work using a mix of open source and cloud-based services.

Over time I have adopted patterns, configurations, and technologies that have made my life easier. Occasionally, I put pen to paper, so to speak, and share my experiences with others. Some time ago, I started an [IT How To](https://github.com/taw00/howto) repository. And now, I aim to do the same but focused on writing. Thus, this GitHub repo was born.

The objective of this repository is to be a dumping ground of howtos for writers who prefer to work using free and open source tools. I'm not entirely sure of the scope of this just yet, but for now, it will merely reflect the tools and experiences I bring to the table. I like to experiment, and therefore, it will not be limited to pure open source. But I will definitely be coming at it from a Linux-first perspective, though many of the tips and tricks will apply to anyone using the same tools on any desktop platform.

I hope you find this valuable, and I invite all of you to send me corrections and suggestions. Thanks!

## What's in this GitHub repo?

* The [Documents](./Documents) folder.  
  Howtos, tips-n-tricks, configurations, etc. Check out my how to on leveraging LibreOffice to format your manuscript. My thoughts on Google Docs. A discussion of fonts. Setting up your Linux machine to make typing em dashes and Chicago-style ellipses far easier. And much more.
* The [Artifacts](./Artifacts) folder.  
  Templates, examples, css, all in support of everything articulated in the Documents folder.

## What's _not_ in this GitHub repo?

- Discussion of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  
  [Scrivener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrivener_(software)), [Novlr](https://novlr.org/), [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/), [Vellum](https://vellum.pub/), [Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word), [Publisher](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/publisher), [InDesign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_InDesign), [QuarkExpress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuarkXPress), [Framemaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_FrameMaker), and the like. But they may be mentioned in passing or in general statements.
- [Abiword](https://www.abisource.com/)  
  At one point in time, Abiword was the darling of the open source community. But today the project is on life support, and has been for a decade or more. It is useful for certain things, but LibreOffice put a stake in poor Abiword's heart. Maybe someday someone will make Abiword relevant again.
- [Docbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook)  
  I have worked with docbook in the past, but I don't think it fits for this kind of writing. I may mention it in passing. But who knows? If I ever do serious technical writing again, maybe I will revisit this topic.
- _Advanced_ typesetting guidance.  
  I am an amateur when it comes to typesetting, but I will do my best to ensure anything I state is accurate.
- Self-publishing guidance (at least for now).  
  I'm no expert. Do your own research. I hear lots of good things about a lot of providers—Lulu, BookBaby, Kobo, and others. In the past, there was Lulu and really no one else. The field has widened. [Joanna Penn](https://www.thecreativepenn.com/) is the queen of self-publishing. Subscribe to her podcast and review her site. She knows what she is talking about.
- Audiobooks.  
  I know nothing about audiobooks (but Ms. Penn does, see above).
- Thoughts on query letters and the publishing process. Not yet anyway.
- Thoughts on submission to literary journals and the like. You are more likely to see a discussion on this topic on my blog, [Ruminations](https://errantruminant.com/blog/).

Write well.
